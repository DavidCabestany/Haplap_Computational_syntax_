# Computational Syntax

Welcome to the "Computational Syntax" repository! This repository contains my solutions to the assignments and practical tasks from the course on Computational Syntax.

## Course Description

The main objective of this course is to present the main concepts and models for the computational treatment of morphology, including regular expressions, finite-state automata, and computational morphology. The course focuses on languages with rich morphology and uses the foma tool, a free and open-source tool for finite-state processing.

Additionally, the course provides an overview of the computational treatment of syntax. It covers context-free grammars, finite-state syntax, and statistical models. Various formalisms such as Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), and Constraint Grammar will be presented. The course also explores Tagging, Chunking, and Parsing in the context of syntax.

Overall, the course aims to demonstrate the crucial role that computational morphology and syntax play in applications that leverage language technology.

## Syllabus

The course covers the following topics:

1. **Introduction to Computational Syntax**: An overview of the course and its objectives.

2. **Finite-State Syntax**:
   - Assignment of Syntactic Categories (POS tagging).
   - Knowledge-based approaches (Constraint Grammar).
   - Data-driven approaches (statistical methods).
   - Chunking, with a focus on Multiword expressions (MWE).

3. **Context-Free Grammars**:
   - Basic model for describing syntax.
   - Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars.
   - Unification-based Grammars.

4. **Dependency Syntax**:
   - Rule-based approaches to dependency syntax.
   - Data-driven approaches to dependency syntax.

## Assignments

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the assignments and practical tasks given during the course. Each assignment is organized into separate directories, and the solutions are provided in the form of code, notebooks, or reports, as applicable.

## Note

These solutions are intended to serve as references and examples for fellow students. If you are currently enrolled in the same course, I encourage you to attempt the assignments independently before referring to these solutions.

## Disclaimer

While these solutions can aid your understanding of computational syntax concepts and implementations, please refrain from submitting them as your own work for grading purposes. Upholding academic integrity is of utmost importance.
